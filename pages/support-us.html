<p>
    Funding is our biggest roadblock, and we rely on the generosity of sponsors to make our goals a reality.
    Your contributions will directly support our team’s journey, from parts and materials to tools and testing facilities.
    Together, we can showcase the power of student engineering at the 2025 Baja SAE.
