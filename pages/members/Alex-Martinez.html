            As Lead Engineer, I have the exciting challenge of overseeing the technical development of our car, from initial designs to the final race-ready machine.
            I’m passionate about pushing the limits of automotive technology, exploring new materials, and integrating cutting-edge engineering solutions.
            Working with such a talented, driven team has been an amazing experience, and I’m grateful to be part of a club that shares my dedication to innovation, precision, and performance.
