    The Competition brings together teams from around the world to test engineering skills, innovation, and speed.
    Each year, our team races a custom-built car, pushing limits in performance, design, and teamwork.
</p>
<p>
    The annual competition is a thrilling showcase where college teams from around the world gather to test the results of months of hard work, engineering innovation, and teamwork.
    Each team designs and builds their own race car, putting their technical expertise and problem-solving skills to the test.
    With strict regulations governing everything from vehicle weight to power efficiency, the competition challenges teams to push the limits of creativity within real-world engineering constraints.
    This demanding process not only sharpens technical skills but also fosters collaboration and resilience, as students navigate the many challenges of bringing their designs to life.

    For our club, the competition is more than just a race—it’s a culmination of passion, learning, and growth.
    Preparing for race day involves rigorous testing, troubleshooting, and last-minute adjustments to ensure every component functions seamlessly.
    Through these intense preparations, our team members develop a strong foundation in engineering principles and project management.
    The competition also provides invaluable networking opportunities, allowing students to connect with industry professionals and like-minded peers, making it a unique and rewarding experience that fuels both personal and professional growth.

<h2 id="our-club">Our Club</h2>
<p>
    Our club is a community of passionate students who bring together diverse skills and perspectives to design, build, and race a custom-engineered car.
    With a shared commitment to innovation and excellence, we strive to create a vehicle that not only meets competition standards but stands out for its performance and design.
    Our members, coming from various engineering and business backgrounds, collaborate closely on every aspect of the project—from initial design sketches and calculations to the final assembly and testing phases.
    This hands-on experience allows us to apply classroom knowledge in real-world scenarios, fostering a deep understanding of the engineering process and teamwork.
</p>
<p>
    Beyond building a car, our club cultivates an environment of learning, support, and growth.
    Each year, new members join and bring fresh ideas, while experienced members mentor and guide them, creating a continuous cycle of skill development and innovation.
    We encourage our members to step outside their comfort zones, learn new tools, and take on leadership roles that prepare them for careers in engineering and beyond.
    Our club is more than just a project; it’s a platform for personal and professional growth, where students can pursue their passion for automotive engineering while making lasting friendships and connections.
